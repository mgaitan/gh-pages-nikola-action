# GitHub Pages Nikola Build Action

This action builds a Nikola project and deploys it to GitHub Pages.

Please ensure a `requirements.txt` is present for your site and installs
`nikola` and other requirements needed to build your site.

A `requirements.txt` can be generated by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
in the virtual environment your nikola site is developed in.

## Environment variables

  - `GH_PAGES_BRANCH` (optional): override the default `gh-pages` deployment branch
  - `NIKOLA_CONFIG_FILE` (optional): override the default `conf.py` config file
